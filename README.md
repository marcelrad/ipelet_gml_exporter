# Ipe GML Exporter
A simple tool to a export a graph modeled in Ipe to gml format. The tool passes the generated output to your console. With *ipe your_file.ipe > graph.gml* you can pipe the output into a file. This Ipelete only handels the current page. 
 
* Marks represent nodes
* Segments are undirected edges
* Optionally you can add a text label to a mark. Then this text is used as node label instead of an id.

#Installation

#Compatibility
Tested with Ipe 7.1.5
